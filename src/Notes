A component is a function returning a some Jsx;

we can create component using two ways  in React.

Functional components (also referred to as "presentational", "dumb" or "stateless" components - more about this later in the course) => const cmp = () => { return <div>some JSX</div> } (using ES6 arrow functions as shown here is recommended but optional)
class-based components (also referred to as "containers", "smart" or "stateful" components) => class Cmp extends Component { render () { return <div>some JSX</div> } } 

It is preferred way to create component use new js file and for using the new component we have to import hat into the app.js file.


Props
This is used  to take attribute values which is passed to the selector. Also we can get the child value s using the props.\
like 

<created template name ="xyz" age =" 24"> 
    My name is test value
</created template>

We get name and age attribute values , inner values ( here we can get the  my name is test value ) such as ul tag ,any other component selector.

Getting the value of the props in the Functional components we hve to use {props.(attribute name)}.

Getting the value of the props in the class-based components we hve to use {this.props.(attribute name)}.

We can access children using props.children
